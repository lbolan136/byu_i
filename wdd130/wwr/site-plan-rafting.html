    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>[Class V Whitewater Geopolitics is devoted to showing the power and application of geospatial technologies such as GIS, spatial data science, computer learning, and remote sensing to the wicked geopolitical problems of today. The productive utilization of geospatial technologies to visualize open-source data allows analysts, policymakers, executives, and the common public to anticapate threats and glean the information necessary to "pivot" quickly in a multipolar world. Without understanding the "geographic piviot of history", and those other pivot points, one cannot forecast the future and seize the day after tomorrow.]</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>[My target customers are white, upper-to-middle class, middle age, Silicon Slopes executives with foreign travel and experience, to including but not only missions, military, and peacebuilding experience. Allowing them to translate and see primary open-sources for themselves as lifelong learners will allow them to opportunely capitalize on the geopolitical options in a multipolar world. They want to know how geopolitical tensions around the world will impact their bottom line, influence the security of their personnel and supply chains, and to build resilience in a chaotic world where the United States refuses to play as number one. My customers will access their website on desktop, laptop, and mobile device depending on business travel, meetings, and remote meetings.]</p>

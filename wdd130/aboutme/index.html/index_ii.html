    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Logan Bolan</h2>
    <h2>Bolan kao dje si Bolan na bosanskom slengu or Dr. Dude for short, or Dragi Bolan (sweet dude)</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Logan Bolan. My last name means dude in Bosnian slang, and has a bunch of silly phrases associated with it such as "what's up dude", "come on dude", "let's go dude", etc.
        I am a recent Geography graduate from Utah State University and I have too many degrees and certificates such as in Peacebuilding. I work as a GIS analyst for the State of Alaska DOT, but want to work in diplomacy or peacebuilding. I like to hunt, fish, shoot bows and guns, read, write, and make maps. I want to be more of a conflict geographer or GIS developer. You can find out more about me here:

        I'm single and trying to mingle!
         I love how BYU Idaho focuses on early employablity and a skills based curriculum. I am pursuing the certificate so I can be more valuble to my employer.
         What degree are you pursuing? Just the Web and Computer Programming Certificate. https://www.byupathway.org/certificate/web-computer-programming
        The advantages you see from learning about careers in web design, why you are taking the course, what you hope to get out of it, and how you will use the information in your personal or professional life.
         I didn't really learn the basics of programming at USU, and I need to have a broader base in programming in and out of GIS in order to work as a GIS Developer, or OSINT investigator, or conflict geographer. Knowing webdesign will allow me to customize websites and increase my payscale quite a lot. For context, I make about $48,000 per year as a state employee. The average web developer in the US makes about $72,000 a year. I want to do more with my abilities and make more what I think I am worth.
        How long have you been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints?  
                I'm a lifelong member of the Church.</p>
